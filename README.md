# just.qr

a simple qr code generator.

* enter text, get a qr code.
* that's it.

got tired of finding "free" qr code generators that never gave me my raw information, to later get greeted be a paywall.

descided to assamble my own that runs 100% in the browser; easy hosting for me and anyone else wishing to have their own.

built with react + vite.
